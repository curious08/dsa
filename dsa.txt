before moving to dsa we are going to take some examples
Music Players --> Spotify, Gana, Jio Savan

data --> .mp3 songs
searching, sorting, queue

Linked list ---> Music Players

Spam email detection
-----------------------
10 unknown company ---> 10 spam per day
throw 'xyz' ---> spam
String data structure ----> spam emails

Data Structure:
---------------
Arranging data in a proper structure is called as Data Structure or organizing data is 
called as Data Strucutre.

The following are various operation we can perform on Data Structures
	
	1. inserting new data
	2. deletion of existing data
	3. updation of existing data
	4. Searching (Linear, Binary)
	5. Sorting
	etc

Algorithm
---------
Step by step to solve a problem is called algorithm
concentration on design part and implementaion on java
english instruction

Problem statement
=======================
implement a program to perform addtion of two programms

Alg
	1. read two numbers from user
	2. use arithmetic operator to calculate result
	3. c=a+b;
	4. print result to console, screen, file or database

Implementation:
	
	int addition(int a, int b)
	{
		int c;
		c = a + b;
		return c;
	}

java code:

class Demo
{
	static int addition(int a, int b)
	{
		int c;
		c = a + b;
		return c;
	}
}

class  Test
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println(Demo.addition(1,2));//3
	}
}


some example and various possible solution we will foucs
==========================================================
1.  addition of two numbers
2.  swapping of two numbers
3.  max of two numbers
4.  even or odd of two numbers
5.  sum of n natural numbers
6.  max of three numbers
7.  factorial
8.  prime number or not
9.  fibnacci series
10. tribonocii series

which data structure followed in Gallery Application?
Stack

sending emails to People
-----------------------------
200 students
send a mail to all students
data structure => Queue

File Explorer|Directory Explorer|Folder explorer
-------------------------------------------------
=> c:\code
data structure => Tree

GPS Navigation System
---------------------------
Travel from one location to another location
data structure =>Graph

trending videos in youtube which data strucure is used sir? just guess
-----------------------------------------------------------
Priority Queue

Q ---> V1(2M), V2(5M), V3(1M), V4(6M), V5(3M)

Sorting ---> V4, V2, V5, V1, V3

Problem Statement:
Write a program to swap two given integers.
-----------------------------------------
Algorithm:
	=> read two parameters from the user
	=> implement business logic related to swapping
	
	logic1
	logic2
	logic3
	logic4
	logic5
	=> print the data before swapping and after swapping

Note: In java call by refrence concept is not there.
logic1:
	=> declare one temp variable
	=> print a and b value
	    temp = a;
	    a = b;
	    b = temp;
	=> print a and b value
